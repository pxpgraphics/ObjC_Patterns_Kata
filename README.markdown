Objective-C Design Patterns Kata
================================
This project was inspired by my teammate [nazgob](http://github.com/nazgob), who created similar project in C++.

Long story short, it's for practicing Objective-C and for design patterns reference.

How and When
------------
After I study one of design pattern from famous Gang of Four book, I'm trying to implement it in Objective-C.
When? When I have some spare time.

Excuses, excuses
----------------
Please don't shout at me that interfaces and implementations are in the same file (really whole single pattern is in a single file). This is for sake of simplicity and fast reference of all classes taking part in specific design pattern implementation.

Any suggestions, questions and comments are more then welcome.

Installation
------------
Nothing really to do. Fork the project or just download it.

Compilation
-----------
This project contains X-Code project file, so compilation should go as smoothly as possible.
There is one target named "All" (brilliant name, isn't it?), which compiles all other targets (what a surprise).
If you have any errors or warning, just write to me.

Running
-------
After compilation will finish successfully, in your build directory you will see executables in the number of currently implemented design patterns. Name of the executable corresponds to the name of the design pattern (you wouldn't know, do you? ;).
